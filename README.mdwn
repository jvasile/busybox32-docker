This will make a busybox docker image and stick it in Docker, then
delete the temp rootfs.

We grabbed
https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/contrib/mkimage/busybox-static
under the Apache license to make the temp rootfs, then just roll it in
to Docker. You can verify it's there with `docker images`.

We call the created image busybox32 because I'm assuming you're
building this on a 32-bit system. If you're on a 64-bit system, just
pull the 64-bit image from Docker repositories. It's called busybox.

`sh mkimage_busybox.sh` to run the script and put the image in docker.
